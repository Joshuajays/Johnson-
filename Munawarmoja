## Authentication

User authentication consists of two steps:

1. obtaining user accessToken using Pi SDK
2. verifying accessToken using Pi Platform API

<br />

> Disclaimer:
>
> Pi SDK method Pi.authenticate() should only be used to retrieve user accessToken and MUST be verified on the backend side of your app.
>
> For a detailed guide on how to use Pi SDK, please refer to [SDK Docs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/blob/master/SDK_reference.md)
>
> Pi Platform API should remain the only source of truth about user data in your app (a malicious user could tamper with the requests and send you wrong data).
>
> For a detailed guide on how to use Pi Platform API, please refer to [Platform API Docs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/blob/master/platform_API.md)

<br />

### 1. Obtain user data with Pi.authenticate() SDK method

Pi.authenticate() method takes in two arguments: scopes and onIncompletePaymentFound and returns AuthResult object with different keys available.

scopes determine what keys are available on the AuthResult object. For full documentation on available scopes, please refer to [SDK Docs](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/blob/master/SDK_reference.md#scopes).

onIncompletePaymentFound is a function that connects both Authorization and Payments flows. To preview example implementation, proceed to [onIncompletePaymentFound](#onincompletepaymentfound) section.

// frontend/src/shop/index.ts

const signIn = async () => {
  const scopes = ["username", "payments"];
  const authResponse = await window.Pi.authenticate(scopes, onIncompletePaymentFound);

  /* pass obtained data to backend */
  await signInUser(authResponse);

  /* use the obtained data however you want */
  setUser(authResponse.user);
};

const signInUser = (authResult: any) => {
  axiosClient.post("/signin", { authResult }, config);

  return setShowModal(false);
};
<br />

### 2. Verify the user by calling Pi Platform API GET /me endpoint

Pi Demo App

https://github.com/Munawarmoja/demo
Pi Demo App is an example of how you can implement the various required flows in your app's code.
It aims to show you how to use Pi Platform API on the backend side and Pi SDK on the frontend side of your app.


It is composed of two major parts:

* **backend**: a backend app (a very simple JSON API built using Node and ExpressJS)
* **frontend**: a single-page frontend app (built using React and create-react-app)


Read [`doc/development.md`](./doc/development.md) to get started and learn how to run this app in development.

> **WARNING**
>
> The demo app uses express session cookies which, in the Sandbox environment, are not correctly saved on the client on some browsers.
> To properly test all of the features of the Demo App, we recommend you to open the sandbox app using Mozilla Firefox.


## Deployment

Read [`doc/deployment.md`](./doc/deployment.md) to learn how to deploy this app on a server using Docker and docker-compose.


## Flows

To dive into the implementation of the flows that support the demo app features, please refer to
[Pi Demo App Flows](./FLOWS.md).




Frontend Javascript SDK

The JS SDK is the frontend SDK, designed to be used in your HTML pages or Single-Page Apps, served in the Pi Browser.

In order to enable the SDK to function correctly, you need to declare your apps on the Developer Portal (open
develop.pi in the Pi Browser to access the Developer Portal).

This SDK is not for a server-side NodeJS app.


In order to make sure that all involved parties (your app, your server, the Pi servers, and the Pi Blockchain) are in sync,
the payment needs to go through a Server-Side Approval flow (for User-to-App payment) and/or a Server-Side Completion
flow (for all types of payments).

Please refer to:
* [the full Payments documentation](./payments.md) to learn about the complete payment flow
* [the Advanced Payments documentation](./payments_advanced.md) to learn about App-to-User payment flow
* [the Platform API documentation](./platform_API.md) to learn how to confirm the payment and acknowledge it from your
  server
* [the client SDK documentation](./SDK_reference.md) to learn about Pi Apps SDK and provided methods in detail
* [the Demo App](https://github.com/pi-apps/demo) to view an example of how you can implement the various required flows in your app's code
